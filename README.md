# Dota2_TI_Prizepool
A fun project I toyed around with to predict the final prizepool of the Dota 2 International Tournament c. 2015
Based on several criteria/events, such as the timing of when 'Immortal Treasures' could/were released to spike ticket sales

The prizepool was directly proportional to the number of ticket sales
(25% of ticket sales went towards the prize pool)
